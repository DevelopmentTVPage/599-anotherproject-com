    "description": "Our sensor mirror lights up automatically as your face approaches. Its tru-lux light system simulates natural sunlight, allowing you to see full color variation, so you'll know when your makeup is color-correct and flawless. And unlike traditional bulbs or fluorescent lighting, our long-lasting LEDs won't burn out or diminish even after many years of regular use. We designed it to be cordless, so there are no messy cords cluttering up your counterspace. It easily recharges with the included USB cord and adapter. The distortion-free mirror is 5x magnification \u2014 ideal for providing exceptional detail while still allowing you to see your entire face at once.",
