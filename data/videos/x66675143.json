    "description": "Marc Fosh's tip\n\nThis tart is so moist and the pasty melts in your mouth. I like to eat it on its own, but you can serve it with ice cream, cr\u00e8me fraiche or double cream. For extra fruitiness, scatter some raisins over the top of the cooked apple.\n\nThis recipe was prepared using the Braun Multiquick 5 hand blender and with its whisk accessory and Compact Kitchen Machine with kneading hook.",
