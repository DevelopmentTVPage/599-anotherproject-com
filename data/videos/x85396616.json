    "description": "When it comes to accurately taking a child\u2019s temperature, doctors trust the precise Braun ThermoScan\u00ae Ear thermometer above all others. ThermoScan\u00ae provides professional accuracy thanks to its patented, pre-warmed soft tip. The tip on other thermometers can cool the area where the reading is taken, which can lead to inaccurate readings. The tip on the ThermoScan\u00ae is warmed before use to prevent this and ensure professional accuracy. Patented ExacTemp\u00ae positioning system confirms good position in the ear with a light and a beep. Disposable Braun certified lens filters help prevent the spread of germs. And with its large screen and ergonomic design, ThermoScan\u00ae is simple to use.\n\nDiscover why the Braun ThermoScan\u00ae is the No. 1 brand among doctors*.\n\n*No. 1 in awareness, usage and recommendation.
